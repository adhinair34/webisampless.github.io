		<h3>Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s,
		when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to <p style="fontsize :25px";text-align="justify">
		make a type specimen book.</p><p style="fontsize :25px" text-align:justify">
		It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. </p><p style="fontsize :25px" text-align:justify">
		It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software 
		like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</p></p>

		<h3>Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin 
		literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock,<p style="fontsize :25px" text-align:justify">
		a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur,
		Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum"</p>
		(The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance.<p style="fontsize :25px" text-align:"justify">
		The first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..", comes from a line in section 1.10.32.</p>
